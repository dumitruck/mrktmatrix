Internal organization matrix with drag and drop functionality
Imagine you have a small company where you have X number of tasks, so you need to assign 
Those task to different stuff in your team.
For that you're doing a table with X lines of tasks and each task has assigned a name, an e-mail, a phone NR, an username to it.
This table in the end is shared with everyone in the company so everyone knows who does what.
This organization matrix is changing often so we would want to update the table easy with drag and drop option.
When I take username cell for example and drag it down, the other bunch of cells will move along with user id cell, 
But not the task cell, which is ment to stay in fixed position, only stuff assigned with it's other details cells will have to be drag able.
Seems complicated but it's much easier.
Also, if possible E-mail field (button) to be actionable as a link to email in outlook.
